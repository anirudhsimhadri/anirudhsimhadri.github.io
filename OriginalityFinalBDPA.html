            The term A.I, or Artificial intelligence gets used by many people, but usually not with the correct definition.
        </div>
    </br>

        <div style="color: red">
            The purest definition of A.I. was first introduced into the world by someone named John McCarthy in 1955 at the Dartmount Conference.

            McCarthy says, "Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it. An attempt will be made to fin how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves."

        <div style="color: purple">
            In small, A.I. is a machiine with the ability to solve problems that are normally solved by humans with the natural intelligence of mankind intelligence.

    </br>
        <div style="color: blue">
            The 1955 proposal defines 7 areas of A.I. The original seven are Simulating Higher Functions of the Human Brain, Programming a computer to use general lanuage, Arranging hypothetical neurons in a manner so that they can form concepts, A way to deterimine and measure problem complexity, self improvement, abstraction: defined as the quality of dealing with ideas rather than events, Randomness and creativity.
        </div>
    </br>

        <div style="color: blue">
            All of these proposals that define the 7 areas of A.I. lead to the world that it is now. Although that might not be the good and moral world that you might think either. Artificial Intelligence has been used as digital spies, they have been used to get data on people without their permission, and many other illegal things. Yet, no one has done anything to confront this problem yet. Read more on The End of Life Artical using the link below.
