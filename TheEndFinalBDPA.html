            Artificial Intelligence can be bad too.

        <div  style="color: red">
            For example, there have been rumors throughout 2019 about the FBI, Government, Google, Alexa, and other companies using A.I, like Google Home, Google Hub, Google Mini, Alexa, and others to get information about people without them knowing.
        </div>
    </br>
        <div style="color: purple">
            Although most people may say that these rumors are false, there have been instances that seem to prove this mindset wrong.

        <div style="color: purple">
            When a women was having a conversation with her husband on her phone, he noticed that her Alexa was recording her conversation.
        </div>
    </br>
        <div style="color: blue">
            Another instance shows a man asking alexa various questions all related to the FBI and Government, and after the man finished listing his questions, Alexa mysteriously turned itself off and didnt respond.
        </div>

        <div style="color: rgb(255, 166, 0)">
            There are many more times like these that have been recorded and used as solid evidence as to why Artificial Intelligence like these systems and many other forms of A.I. may be bad for our society.
